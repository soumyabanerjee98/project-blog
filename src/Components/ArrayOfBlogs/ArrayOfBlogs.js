In this series I’ll introduce you to some inspiring and ambitious friends I’ve met on the road — friends who have found viable work away from their home countries.  Do you guys read Further Bound? If not, I recommend adding it to your reading list immediately. After years of mutual blog fandom, Further Bound author Hannah and I finally met during my last trip to London. We hit it off immediately and I was thrilled when we bumped back into each other once again during my latest trip to Indonesia. This time, I also met Hannah’s charming Scottish partner, Lee Vine. Over dinner at the local market, Lee mentioned his adventures as a canyoning guide in India, a decision he perhaps regretted when I started pestering him for an interview. Ever wonder what it’s like to spend your days leading high-adrenaline outdoor adventures? Over to Lee to find out!",

But the real draw for her main audience, who already know Red like the back of their hands, is the new material. Some of it is new only in the sense of being newly attached to this album or newly reclaimed by Taylor: “Ronan” was a one-off charity single in 2012; Little Big Town recorded “Better Man,” a stolen rearview glance on the drive away from toxic love, in 2016; and the venom-laced air kiss “Babe” was released by the country duo Sugarland in 2018. Most anticipated is an extended cut of a classic: “All Too Well,” a Red track with an outsize presence in Swift lore.",

        desc: "The Akshay Kumar starrer Sooryavanshi released a while back, and since then the film has been doing brisk business at the box office. After opening to a thunderous response from the audience, the business of the film saw good growth as the days progressed. Being the first big ticket Bollywood entertainer to hit screens post the second lockdown, expectations from the film were at an all-time high. Not surprisingly, Sooryavanshi that saw a release across 3000+ screens, has surpassed expectations. In this box office report, we take a look at the second weekend collections of Sooryavanshi while comparing the same to Akshay Kumar’s previous releases that have made it to their second weekend in theatres. Collecting Rs. 30.57 cr, Sooryavanshi has become Akshay’s third highest second weekend grosser. Though the business of the film does not surpass the collections of Akshay’s previous releases like Mission Mangal that collected Rs. 36.45 cr, and Good Newwz that collected Rs. 34.20 cr. However, the business of the film surpassed the actor’s other releases like Housefull 4 that collected Rs. 29.98 cr, 2.0 that collected Rs. 27 cr, Holiday – A Soldier Is Never Off Duty that collected Rs. 19.52 cr, Airlift that collected Rs. 19.26 cr, Kesari that collected Rs. 19.15 cr, Toilet – Ek Prem Katha that collected Rs. 19 cr, and Jolly LLB 2 that had collected Rs. 17.73 cr.",

With travel demand bouncing back at home, American Airlines wants to expand its international network and India was 'one of the biggest untapped markets' for it, said Tom Lattig, managing director of EMEA sales. 'A lot of customers really want to fly non- stop, particularly as we've come through the pandemic. We know there is huge demand for travel between India and the United States so there is an opportunity right now in the middle of the pandemic to come back,' Lattig said in an interview in New Delhi.       American Airlines, which suspended services to India in 2012, started flying between New Delhi and New York on the weekend and will add flights between India's tech city of Bengaluru and Seattle in March.If it succeeds with those two routes, it will add services to India's financial capital of Mumbai, Lattig said.",

        desc: "People in today’s day and age have become very prudent about what they consume. However, with the influx of multiple brands, new foods, and establishments offering various types of edibles, it is crucial to have a system that rates the vivid variety of foods. Researchers at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, have devised a nutrient profiling system that tallies and weighs the nutritional characteristics, and rates different kinds of foods depending on their effect on the overall health of the body. Monikered as ‘Food Compass,’ this tool has been developed after the research and development done across a period of three years and includes data collected on 8,032 foods and beverages consumed by the American populace, reported Tufts Now - the news website of Tufts University.        “Once you get beyond the general health advice related to food, the public is still oblivious to the method of ranking their meals and the choice of establishments offering food. Therefore, not just consumers, but policymakers and people associated with the food industry aim for guiding people towards healthier food habits,” Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean, Friedman School, was quoted as saying.                The Food Compass developed by the researchers’ analyses various foods and beverages around 54 different characteristics across nine domains. Abiding by the findings of the tool, people can expect a reinforced insight into the science of food, which will, in turn, make it easier for them to decide what to eat to lead a healthy lifestyle.                According to the Food Compass, anything with a score below 30 should be consumed to the minimum, followed by things falling in the range of 31-69, which should be consumed in moderation.   For example, snack and sweet deserts have acquired an average score of 16.4, which means that these edibles should be consumed with a pinch of salt (not literally). Vegetables and fruits have earned a score ranging between 73.9-100, which suggests that these should occupy a major part of your diet. Poultry scored 42.67, beef scored 24.9, while seafood scored 67 on the Food Compass.",

Sonos called that contention “nonsense.”        Sonos, an early proponent of connected home speakers, has claimed that Google gained knowledge of the technology through a partnership to integrate Google Play into the Sonos platform, and then decided to sell its own product line and undercut Sonos on price.              In a court filing Tuesday, the Alphabet unit said “Google, not Sonos, conceived of the cloud queue idea” and thus should be listed as owner and inventor of two of the Sonos patents. It also contends a 2013 Content Integration Agreement prohibits Sonos from claiming ownership of any technology developed during the partnership.",

Poultry scored 42.67, beef scored 24.9, while seafood scored 67 on the Food Compass.",

        desc: "People in today’s day and age have become very prudent about what they consume. However, with the influx of multiple brands, new foods, and establishments offering various types of edibles, it is crucial to have a system that rates the vivid variety of foods. Researchers at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, have devised a nutrient profiling system that tallies and weighs the nutritional characteristics, and rates different kinds of foods depending on their effect on the overall health of the body. Monikered as ‘Food Compass,’ this tool has been developed after the research and development done across a period of three years and includes data collected on 8,032 foods and beverages consumed by the American populace, reported Tufts Now - the news website of Tufts University.        “Once you get beyond the general health advice related to food, the public is still oblivious to the method of ranking their meals and the choice of establishments offering food. Therefore, not just consumers, but policymakers and people associated with the food industry aim for guiding people towards healthier food habits,” Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean, Friedman School, was quoted as saying.                The Food Compass developed by the researchers’ analyses various foods and beverages around 54 different characteristics across nine domains. Abiding by the findings of the tool, people can expect a reinforced insight into the science of food, which will, in turn, make it easier for them to decide what to eat to lead a healthy lifestyle.                According to the Food Compass, anything with a score below 30 should be consumed to the minimum, followed by things falling in the range of 31-69, which should be consumed in moderation.

With travel demand bouncing back at home, American Airlines wants to expand its international network and India was 'one of the biggest untapped markets' for it, said Tom Lattig, managing director of EMEA sales. 'A lot of customers really want to fly non- stop, particularly as we've come through the pandemic. We know there is huge demand for travel between India and the United States so there is an opportunity right now in the middle of the pandemic to come back,' Lattig said in an interview in New Delhi.       American Airlines, which suspended services to India in 2012, started flying between New Delhi and New York on the weekend and will add flights between India's tech city of Bengaluru and Seattle in March.If it succeeds with those two routes, it will add services to India's financial capital of Mumbai, Lattig said.",
